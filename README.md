## Goals of this project:

- Parse the Kanji DB parts and create a simple list with all the kanjis in the database as well as simple information such as meaning, kunyomi and onyomi, level, and the kanji itself.
- For each kanji create a single JSON file that contains all of the metadata of each parsed kanji.
